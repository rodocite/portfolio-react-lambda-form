# Portfolio - React/Lambda Event Planner App
This project is a "serverless" proof of concept using Amazon Lambda.

# Why?
I've always been interested in Lambda. This is a first set of projects where I'm back-end functionality into AWS Lambda instead of using a traditional provisioned server.

# Stack
Amazon Lambda
AWS DynamoDB
AWS S3
AWS Cognito
React
Webpack
Babel
ES6
